### FAR VISION:
The tool or Wordpess plugin gives real-time update on the sales ranks of a list of books/market against your selected books, and traffic for prospective content. Use of the app is for competitive analysis so authors may determine which books sell well, and how their own book is doing comparatively. The app will also allow authors to see what potential readers are searching for to develop and market content accordingly. The app may also compare other author's website traffic or online "buzz", for example using comparative search hits from Alexa, comments and ratings from Amazon, and mentions across the web. We aim to pull data and resuls from Amazon, Barnes and Noble, GoodReads, Google, Alexa, Bing, Yahoo, and others. 

### NEAR VISION 
Prototype of the dashboard, live on a wordpress site, and conforms to a WP plug in guidelines 
-	Author facing dashboard
-	Pull data at least from Amazon.com for data
-	Customer facing options (shows to reader) – status and metrics against selected books, as permissioned by author

### STAKEHOLDERS
* Authors – who want know their competitive position for a book listed on Amazon
* Readers – who want to know how popular a book is
* Editors of the blog – deciding what content to post by popularity of existing books, or to choose books to feature for posts.
* Publishers – that want to know the popularity of content, success metrics, and to share books

### DETAIL PERSONA OF REAL STAKEHOLDER:
Geri Walton has long been fascinated by history and the people who create it. As a child growing up in a large family in Utah, she loved to sit around in a big circle with family members, sharing stories. Her father’s many stories—from not only his own childhood but the lives of their ancestor’s—particularly fascinated her.

After a long career in technical writing and publishing in the computer industry, Geri returned to history as her first love. She worked on several different books, articles, and blog ideas before realizing her passion was around the history and people of the 1700s and 1800s. So, she started her current blog in 2013.

Geri lives in Northern California with her husband, son, and two Pomeranians. When she’s not writing, she enjoys reading, cooking, and jogging. She is also a bit of a health nut. Geri graduated summa cum laude with BA in History from San Jose State University.

Geri would like the ability to see how her book is doing compared with other books, wants to understand the book market, and see how her competitors/other authors are doing in regards to search traffic, website rankings, and other relevant metrics.

### FICTIONAL PERSONA WANTS:
Authors:
Authors want the ability to see how their book is doing, determine the best content to write about, and see how the market is evolving in their space.

Readers:
Readers want to know the most popular content, see how books rank, and learn about new subjects and content relevant to their interests.

Editors:
Blog editors want to be able to drive traffic, publish new content, and see new sources of books/content for ideas to publish on their blogs.

Publishers:
Publishers want to get an understanding of the market, see how categories of books are performing, and get an idea as to how their authors/books perform.

### Product Backlog Item (PBI) Story Points:
- Story Points were estimated based on judgements of effort and difficulty
- The entire team is considered a part of the developement team, as such, only developers were involved in the Story Point estimates
- We used the app Planning Poker online on the evening of 10/29 to estimate PBI points - points ranged from 3-34 points per Backlog Item.

### Rationale for ordering backlog:
We ordered our backlog based on the user use case (Authors first), then data source (Amazon first), and complexity/dependency (sub-groups are dependent features that first require another use case to be fully developed, in order to function properly).

### Definition of Ready 
a) Stakeholder defined
b) Includes the specific outlines of the feature
c) User story includes the reason or purpose for the feature
d) Must determine the data source (if applicable) for the feature
e) PBI story points estimated via Planning Poker by the team
f) Must understand the dependency of the feature with other user stories (sub-groups).
